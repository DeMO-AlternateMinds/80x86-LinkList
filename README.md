This was done using console32 and Visual Studios Community Edition.
Please Read Notice Before Using



Important Notice: While testing, there was an odd issue with memory usage. I am uncertain whether it was just Visual Studios or an issue with memory allocation related to the program. The PC being used has roughly 23GB of RAM and while solely working on this, I had to restart the PC because over 90% of my memory was being used and slowing down the computer. 

My assumption is that after the program ends, the memory is not being freed (memeory is not being deallocated). Either it was due to the way I was debuging the code and potentially the space was not deallocated before being the program was terminated or there is a deeper issue prevalent.
